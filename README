INTRODUCTION

The idea behind this rails cookbook (and repo in general) is to be able to be
able to generate a new rails project without polluting your host machine with
the rails gem.

The rails and application recipes make some assumptions about what technologies
you'll be using for your rails stack (MySQL, haml, rspec, etc.). Feel free to
edit the recipes if you'd prefer to use others.

USAGE

Step 0 - Make sure Virtualbox, vagrant and the base box are installed:

Install Virtualbox (download from the Virtualbox website)
$ sudo gem install vagrant
$ vagrant box add lucid19 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8443957/lucid19.box

Step 1 - Create project directory:

$ mkdir /path/to/project_name
$ cp Vagrantfile /path/to/project_name/.
$ cp -r cookbooks /path/to/project_name/.

Step 2 - Edit the Vagrantfile:

$ cd /path/to/project_name
Edit the Vagrantfile, replacing the app name on these two lines:
   => vm.name = "App Name"
   => :rails => { :app_name => "app_name" }

Step 3 - Provision the box:

$ vagrant up

Step 4 - Possibly reload:

Sometimes apache won't restart properly on the first pass, so just reload
$ vagrant reload

Once apache is up and running you should should be able to visit
http://192.168.34.10/ and you'll get the default rails index page. To execute
commands within the box use "vagrant ssh". More info on how to use vagrant is
available at http://www.vagrantup.com/
